## Overview

I created a computer-based game of snooker, a popular cue sport in which
players attempt to pocket the object balls in the correct sequence in order
to score points.

## Requirements

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
- [Cinder 0.9.2](https://libcinder.org/download)

## Installations

1. git clone https://github.com/uiuc-fa20-cs126/final-project-rtpatel2
2. Open program in CLion or similar C++ IDE using MSVC2015.
3. Build and run.

## Code Style

This code was written in accordance with the 
[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Note that overloads of Cinder
 functions do not adhere to this Style Guide.
